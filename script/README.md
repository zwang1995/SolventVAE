The first python files were adapted from [Chemical VAE](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae).

For other python files:

* `zw_nlp.py`: optimization modeling

* `zw_prop_pred.py`: prediction of activity coefficient at infinite dilution

* `zw_sampling_between.py`: interpolation between the optimally designed point and the optimal one in the dataset

* `zw_smiles_split.py`: tokenization of SMILES strings considering newly introduced tokens

* `zw_viz.py`: visualization
