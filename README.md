## Molecular Design of Solvents based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Nonlinear Programming (NLP) Optimization

### Description

This repository contains the data and scripts involved in the publication:

***A novel machine learning-based optimization approach for the molecular design of solvents***

to be published in *32nd European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering: Computer Aided Chemical Engineering*.



> ***NOTE: Part of scripts for the VAE model was adapted from [Chemical VAE](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae) GitHub repository.***

### Required packages (Python 3.5)
In addition to the packages used in [Chemical VAE](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae), other packages were used:
* [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/): optimization modeling
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): data processing
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) & [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): visualization

### Commercial software
* COSMOtherm: molecular property calculation
