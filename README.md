> ***NOTE: Part of the scripts for VAE model development was adapted from [Chemical VAE](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae) GitHub repository.***

## Required packages (Python 3.5)
In addition to the packages necessary for [Chemical VAE](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae), other packages were used:
* [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/): optimization modeling
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): data processing
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) & [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): visualization

## Commercial software
* COSMOtherm: molecular property calculation
